##Background
This project is part of my January 2016 goal to learn Angular and Sass. This was also my first time using Grunt.

You can read about it [here](http://kylewassink.com/january-2016-skill-angularjs-and-sass).

##Get a Build
To create a build, simply use the existing project and run ```grunt``` or ```grunt:build``` in the projects root directory.
